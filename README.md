**Insurance Dataset Analysis Project (Without Pandas)**

**Introduction:**

In this beginner project, I conducted an analysis of an insurance dataset to gain insights into the demographic characteristics of insured individuals and understand the relationship between various factors and insurance charges.

**Project Goals:**

My main goals for this project were to:
1. Gain insights into the demographic characteristics of the insured individuals.
2. Understand the relationship between smoking habits and insurance costs.
3. Explore the distribution of individuals based on their region.
4. Investigate the average age of individuals with different characteristics (e.g., smokers vs. non-smokers, individuals with children).

**Dataset Overview:**

The dataset includes information about insured individuals with the following columns:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Children
- Smoker
- Region
- Charges

**Key Findings:**

1. **Average Age:** I found that the average age of insured individuals in the dataset is approximately 39 years.
2. **Distribution by Region:** I observed the distribution of insured individuals across different regions. The Southeast region had the highest number of insured individuals, followed by Southwest, Northwest, and Northeast.
3. **Comparison of Insurance Charges:** I compared the average insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers. On average, smokers tend to have higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers.
4. **Average Age of Individuals with Children:** The average age of individuals who have at least one child is around 40 years.

**Conclusion:**

Based on my analysis, I concluded that this project provides valuable insights for insurance companies in understanding their customer demographics and pricing strategies. Further analysis and exploration could involve investigating additional factors such as BMI, gender, and their impact on insurance charges.

**Future Directions:**

Moving forward, I could explore additional factors and conduct more in-depth analysis to gain deeper insights into insurance pricing strategies and customer demographics.
